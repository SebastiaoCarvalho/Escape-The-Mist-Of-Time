# Escape : The Mist Of Time

## Description 

Have you ever wondered what it would feel like to be stuck on another planet, without knowing how to get back?

You are an astronaut, on a strange planet, covered by a misterious mist, and all you want is to go back to your home planet. 
But escaping this planet won't be an easy task.

## Build
This game prototype was created using Unity version 2021.3.6f1. To create a build of the game, just open the Unity Editor with the right version and select the game folder.
Then press Ctrl + B, to create a build and run.

## Disclaimer
The core mechanic of our game was the time-limit and our goal was to make the player have to plan and strategize what he would do before the time ended, some mechanics are
underdeveloped, like the combat mechanic. If you have trouble understanding if an enemy was hit or not, try using audio cues, because the toughest enemies have audio cues upon 
being hit.
